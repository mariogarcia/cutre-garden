== Add Turbine

I'm using a GOSO F50 - 12V as a water turbine producing around 12v at
most.

You can check how the turbine generates power by blowing following the
direction of the flow and checking with the multimeter. There is an
arrow indicating the direction of the flow.

=== To circuit

The turbine only has two wires:

- **red**: positive
- **black**: ground

Because the Arduino Uno only can measure voltages of 5v top we need to
create a `voltage divider` in order to measure voltages coming from
the turbine.

WARNING: Don't try to measure higher voltages than 5v directly in the
Arduino or your Arduino could be damaged.

Basically I've joined two resistors of `1M` and `100K` in series and I
take the measure in the middle of them. In the following schema think
of the battery as if it was the turbine producing electricity:

Positive of the turbine (red wire) to one end, the ground to the
other. Then the yellow wire from the middle of both resistors to the
arduino analog input 2 (A2), and finally connect the ground from the
breadboard to the Arduino ground pin.
