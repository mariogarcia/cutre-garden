== Add Turbine

I'm using a GOSO F50 - 12V as a water turbine producing around 12v at
most.

=== To circuit

The turbine only has two wires:

- **red**: positive
- **black**: ground

Because the Arduino Uno only can measure voltages of 5v top we need to
create a `voltage divider` in order to measure voltages coming from
the turbine.

WARNING: Don't try to measure higher voltages than 5v directly in the
Arduino or your Arduino could be damaged.
