=== Initial layout

The general layout of the water flow is the following:

- The water intake through the solenoid valve
- Passes through the water flow meter
- And finally the water passes through the turbine producing some power

In order to connect the main project components I've used plumbing flexible hoses
and to avoid any leakage, I've used teflon to reinforce pipe ends.
