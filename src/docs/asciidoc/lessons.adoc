== Lessons learned

This chapter is where I'm adding everything I've learned in the
process of building the project and doesn't fit in any of the previous
chapters.

=== Adding up batteries voltage

In this project I needed a power source of 12v, but I only had two
battery sources of 9v and 3v. I needed to add them up, at least as a
temporary solution. There're two ways of adding up batteries, serial
or parallel.
