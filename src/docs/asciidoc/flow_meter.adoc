== Add Flow Meter

I'm using a water flow sensor YF-S201.

=== To circuit

The flow meter has three wires:

- **red**: for powering the flow meter.  It needs 5v which is
going to be supplied by the 5v pin from the Arduino Uno.
- **black**: which represents the ground, it will be linked to
the ground pin of the Arduino.
- **yellow**: sends data from the flow meter to the digital pin 1
of the Arduino.
