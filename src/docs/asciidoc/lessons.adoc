== Lessons learned

This chapter is where I'm adding everything I've learned in the
process of building the project and doesn't fit in any of the previous
chapters.

=== Adding up batteries voltage

In this project I needed a power source of 12v, but I only had two
battery sources of 9v and 3v. I needed to add them up, at least as a
temporary solution. There're two ways of adding up batteries, serial
or parallel.

.Batteries do BOOM!

While trying to experiment with batteries at home, accidentally I
short-circuited the batteries and a couple of them exploded, spilling
everything they had out. I tell you, it's not a nice experience, so I
thought it would be a good idea to warn you about unwanted outcomings.

- Check your schema is not producing a short-circuit
- Make sure the positive and the negative of the batteries are far
  enough from each other

=== Voltage divider

When measuring voltage with your Arduino, you have to be careful not
trying to measure voltages greater than 5v or you'll ruin your analog
pin.

In order to avoid that, you can apply a voltage divider which is basically
putting the message in the middle of two resistors serially joined, like
the schema:
