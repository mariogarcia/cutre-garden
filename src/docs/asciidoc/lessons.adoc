== Lessons learned

This chapter is where I'm adding everything I've learned in the
process of building the project and doesn't fit in any of the previous
chapters.

=== Adding up batteries voltage

In this project I needed a power source of 12v, but I only had two
battery sources of 9v and 3v. I needed to add them up, at least as a
temporary solution. There're two ways of adding up batteries, serial
or parallel.

While trying to experiment with batteries at home, accidentally I
short-circuited the batteries and a couple of them exploded, spilling
everything they had out. I tell you, it's not a nice experience, so I
thought it would be a good idea to warn you about unwanted outcomings.

- Check your schema is not producing a short-circuit
- Make sure the positive and the negative of the batteries are far
  enough from each other
